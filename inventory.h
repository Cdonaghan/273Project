    /*BRIEF
     To store items user gains throughout the progress of the game. 
    To open or drop items if. Inventory can store unlimited of everything but 
    will only encounter each weapon once.
    So itâ€™ll only be able to store each weapon for one space and not unlimited amounts of the one weapon.

    - will lnk to chest storage class 
    - based off of user commands so may have to implement while loop at the start of the game to check for user command at any point in the game
